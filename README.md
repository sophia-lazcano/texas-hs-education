# A Look into Texas HS Education Success and College Readiness

### About this Project
Hi, welcome to my project repository!ðŸ‘‹ This project serves as my code and data submission for my Texas A&M STAT482 and STAT689 courses' final project, which studies Texas high school education success and college readiness through spatial, graphical, and machine learning methods.

This project looks at 2,120 Texas High School campuses (defined as campuses that offer at least a 12th grade level from the TEA's most recent 2015 report) across 1,108 Texas school districts, 254 Texas counties, and 18,626 Texas block groups.

This project used several technologies:

* Python
* R
  * sf
  * dplyr
  * tidyverse
  * ggplot2
* Google's Geocoding API

Data was derived from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) data pages and from the generous help of Dr. Douglas Wunneburger (TAMU). Shapefiles were either derived online, created by me, or provided by Dr. Wunneburger.
